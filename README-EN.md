##  Overview

The `moviesapi` is a robust software project, primarily developed in C# with.NET Core for building an API for movie data management. The central solution file, `MoviesApi.sln`, serves as the blueprint, coordinating the configurations for both the main application and its corresponding test suite. This dual setup facilitates a seamless software engineering pipeline across development and testing modes—Debug and Release—within the MoviesApi ecosystem.The `MoviesApi.sln.DotSettings.user` file configures JetBrains unit testing environment within Visual Studio solution, enabling continuous test execution across both individual tests in `MoviesApi.Tests` and the entire solution. This allows for swift iterations in writing and validating new code features.For efficient integration tests, a custom database initializer `LocalDbDatabaseInitializer.cs` is implemented, which initializes, maintains, and destroys test databases as needed. With the ability to recreate a database with predefined schema on startup and clearing it upon completion, this utility simplifies testing complex interactions between components within the API.A shared foundation for testing functions is set by the `BaseTests.cs` file, which defines essential scenarios using an In-Memory database, AutoMapper, and custom Authorization handlers. By creating standardized contexts and configurations, this foundation streamlines the creation of consistent tests across diverse functionalities within the API.Lastly, the test project configuration—`MoviesApi.Tests.csproj`

The critical feature here is the implementation of a migration called Reviews which aims to create, modify, or delete tables related to user reviews within the ApplicationDbContext. By managing the evolution and adaptation of these database structures, this migration contributes to the overall flexibility, scalability, and resilience of the Movie API application. This specific review migration was executed on July 10th, 2023. The code achieves this through defining relationships between existing entities like user reviews within the ApplicationDbContext and the model being built by the ModelBuilder class, with proper annotations for product version and other details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Additionally, it defines default genres (Action, Comedy, Drama) and inserts them into the Genders table during upgrades. Conversely, when rolling back changes, this migration deletes these defined genres and removes the Location column from the Cinema table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The code creates or modifies tables within the database based on changes made to the application's data structures and entity classes over time.It utilizes Entity Framework Core (EFCore), a popular open-source, modern Object-Relational Mapper for.NET from Microsoft. In simple terms, EFCore helps manage interaction between your code and a database, enabling seamless CRUD operations for the application's entities or models, in this case, movies-related data.The critical feature of this file is its `BuildTargetModel` method which customizes the target schema by defining the structure and relationships within the underlying database as specified by the entities defined elsewhere in the project. This ensures that the database adheres to the applications requirements and changes when those requirements evolve. |

| [MoviesController.cs](https://github.com/juansdev/moviesapi/blob/master/MoviesApi/Controllers/MoviesController.cs)         | The API manages movies by GETting details, POSTing new entries, PUTing updates, PATCHing partial modifications, and DELETEing entries. The API handles relationships with authors and genres via Includes, maps models using AutoMapper, and stores file content through FileStorage for the movies poster image.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [AuthorsController.cs](https://github.com/juansdev/moviesapi/blob/master/MoviesApi/Controllers/AuthorsController.cs)       | Manages the CRUD operations for Author resources within the Movies API application. Leverages dependency injection to interact with the underlying data context and file storage services. Implements RESTful endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting Author instances based on user requests. Uses AutoMapper for efficient conversion between DTOs and entities.                                                                                                                                        |
| [CustomBaseController.cs](https://github.com/juansdev/moviesapi/blob/master/MoviesApi/Controllers/CustomBaseController.cs) | This CustomBaseController serves as the foundation for API endpoints within the MoviesApi project. It streamlines database operations by abstracting CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions using Entity Framework Core and AutoMapper. This enables easy handling of data entities in a consistent, efficient manner, enhancing maintainability and readability.                                                                                                                                                     |
| [AccountsController.cs](https://github.com/juansdev/moviesapi/blob/master/MoviesApi/Controllers/AccountsController.cs)     | The `AccountsController.cs` file within the `MoviesApi` project manages user authentication for an API. It handles creating new users, logging in, refreshing tokens, and retrieving a list of users for admins, with role assignment and removal functionality for authorized users with the Admin role.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [ReviewController.cs](https://github.com/juansdev/moviesapi/blob/master/MoviesApi/Controllers/ReviewController.cs)         | Manages and processes user reviews for specific movies in a web application, leveraging data models, mappers, authentication, and authorization to ensure secure and seamless interaction. Key functionality includes creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving movie reviews from a database through various HTTP verbs.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [CinemasController.cs](https://github.com/juansdev/moviesapi/blob/master/MoviesApi/Controllers/CinemasController.cs)       | Manages CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on Cinema entities in Movies APIs database. Facilitates geolocation-based cinema searches with filter options like distance and user location. Uses AutoMapper to convert DTOs and Entities. Interacts with ApplicationDbContext to execute queries, ensuring data consistency and correct schema.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [GendersController.cs](https://github.com/juansdev/moviesapi/blob/master/MoviesApi/Controllers/GendersController.cs)       | Manages gender data interactions within the Movies API. This Controller, specifically GendersController, handles all HTTP requests related to genders, including Get, Post, Put, and Delete operations. By leveraging dependency injection, it interacts with Dto and Entity objects seamlessly, ensuring a consistent interface between front-end requests and back-end data structures. Additionally, access control is maintained via the [Authorize] attribute for delete operations, which requires JWT authentication. |
